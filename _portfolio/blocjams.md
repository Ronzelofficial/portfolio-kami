<section class="post-content"><h1> Summary </h1>
      <p> Bloc Jams is a music streaming platform built with angular javascript. Users are able to scroll through songs and albums and listen to what they like. The app contains a fully functioning player bar that allows users to skip songs, pause and play songs, and control volume</p>

<h1> Explanation </h1>
    <p> For this project I wanted to create a platform that would eventually let users upload their own audio files and curate playlists. With the beginings of my coding career working with Bloc, I was tasked with building a basic but fully functioning music streaming platform. </p>

<h1> Problem </h1>
      <p> Bloc Jams was the first application that I have built. Although I had some experience doing javascript challanges, using multiple ideas to build one larger cohesive project was a first. Bloc Jams was built as an SPA or single page application. The site revolves around three different states, a landing page, a collection page, and the album page. However, the pivital part of the application is the player bar.
      </p>
<h1> Solution </h1>
      <p> People today who stream music generally do not want to click around to do simple tasks. That is why the key feature of a easy to use music streaming application is the Player Bar. This custom Player Bar that I built allows the user to do everything in one easy location. One can pause/play, skip songs, adjust volume, and fast forward or rewind.

      </p>
<h1> Results </h1>
      <p> The end effect of this is we get a functioning Player Bar that seemlesly allows the user to navigate through songs while casually listening to music. (insert pb image) </p>
<h1> Conclusion </h1>
      <p> In the future I would liek to expand this project into something that can host music for everyone. Furthermore, I would want the site to be non-profit and therefore allow users to upload copyrighted music, i.e unnoficial remixes. Furthermore, I want to place a heavy emphasis in the curation of playlists to allow users to really express their flavors in music taste. </p>
