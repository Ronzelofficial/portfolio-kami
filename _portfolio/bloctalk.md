<h1> Summary </h1>
<p>Bloc Chat is a chat room built with angular javascript. Users can create a username and specific chat rooms. They can also send and recieve messages. It is built on google's firebase API.</p>

<h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to build a fully functioning chat room that I would later integrate into other applications I build. I believe that communication between like minded people is essential for growth as a community, whatever that community may be. Therefore, I want this chat room t be integrated into my other projects so that users can connect through the site itself.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>The essential part of a chat room is the ability to grab messages from the backend and display them to the user. Furthermore, there is a similar but different functionallity when it comes to a user sending messages. In addition to this, by using Cookies I was able to associate a user with the messages they send. Then by combining that with prompting a username, we knoe who is talking to who. </p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>The solution to this is a combination of the correct configuration in firebasae and javascript code that reaches out and grabs the messages and then displayes it. Similar to the send message functionality.

    </p>

<h1>Results</h1>
    <p>What we end up with is an application where a user can easily send and recieve messages. Combining that with the ability for users to create usernames, we end up with a wonderfull but basic chat room application.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>In conclusion, Bloc Chat is a great application that I plan to weave into more projects I do. For example, as I scale up Bloc Jams, it would be spectacular to integrate the chat room for users to communicate. This would be a much faster way for people to connect, as oppose to a slower paced email functionality found in an application like Soundcloud. </p>
