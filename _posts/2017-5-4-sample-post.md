title: Creativity and the begining
---

I have always loved being creative, doing creative things, and appreciating creativity. For me, it was always music that allowed me to be creative. As my music career evolved and grew I realized that there was a lot of potential applications for upcoming musicians that just weren't around. My goals as a developer was to learn as many tools as I could to allow me to be creative. Like all things, there is a lot to learn before you can just create, unimpeded by a lack of technical skills. Once one gains proficiency in any field it opens up how well one can create and be creative throughout the whole process. 

The first challenges that I really dove into was kata’s on codewars.com. Once I came up with my solutions to the entry level and intermediate kata’s I was able to see what others had done to solve the same issues. Instantly I was hit with tons of solutions to the same problem. In that moment I saw the creativity that I have appreciated my whole life. What some people thought of to solve some of these challenges was spectacular. Codewars split solutions into different categories, the two that I focused in on was ‘best practices’ and ‘clever’. I started diving into all the ‘clever’ solutions and learning whatever I could on top of my daily curriculum. Although it was sometimes hard to piece it all together, it started to turn the wheels in my head about what was possible. 

From there I started building fully functioning applications. And of course, there was a drastic difference between solving a single javascript challenge, and building something with lots of ideas that come together. Because of my music production background I was used to the idea of using lots of elements together to build a larger idea. For example, a full song that I produce can have over 100 tracks that build up that larger song. However, there was a big learning curve transitioning from single javascript challenges to building one application. 

The first application I built was a music streaming site. It began with basic javascript and was then refactored into a single page application using angular javascript. This was my first experience learning what an SPA (single page application) actually was. I realized that most sites and applications that we know and love are built with this logic. It was at that moment that I knew what basic framework I wanted to use to build all of my ideas.
