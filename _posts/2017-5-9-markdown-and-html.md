title: My goals, dreams, and asspirations....... as a developer  
---

Now that I am done with front-end web development I wanted to reflect on what my goals are and how close I feel I am to them. Soon I will be continuing by learning backend and I hope that will make things more clear for me. When I started making music, there was an application widely used by me and almost every other producer out there. If an artist releases a song, and they want to give the song away for free download, they use a fangate. This fanfare forces a user to follow the artist on social media in exchange for a free download. This is so powerful. The first song I released got more than 5k downloads before I had a fangate. I was giving away my song without forcing a follow in exchange for the free download. After passing 5k downloads I still had under 300 followers. The fangate feature I started using after that made my following explode over night. Furthermore, anyone who downloads music for free on soundcloud is very familiar with this application. When I began coding one of my short term goals was to build my own custom fangate for me and my friends to use. Ideally it would have much better analytics and insight into who is downloading your music than other fan gates out there. The relationship between front end and back end seems to be essential in this scenario. This is just one example of something that I want to do. When I first started out, I did not fully realize what a robust amount of knowledge I would need to build even a simple application. One that utilizes backend and frontend logic. 

This time in-between finishing front end and beginning backend is great for thinking about what goals I had and what new goals I have put forward for myself. Things change, and although some of my original goals are still the same, there is a fluidity with what I want to accomplish as a developer. Learning more about development will give me more tools in which to be creative.

Jeykll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Pygments by default.

{% highlight js %}
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
